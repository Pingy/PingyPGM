PingyPGM
========
A badly made clone of PGM from the mind of p i n g y. This may take very long to complete since I don't know much java and I don't really like Java anyways.

What *has* been done?
---------------------
 - Some parts of /map
 - Knowledge of JDOM
 - Check if the maps directory has been already made and generate one if not

TODO
------------------------
 - Support for maps other than bananaCTF
   - Ability to read the maps directory and fetching maps
 - Support for ANY game modes at all
 - Useless raindrops
 - All the other commands
 - Teams
   - Team chats
   - Scoreboard for objectives
 - XML parsing
 - Bar timer
 - Custom tab list
 - Probably a lot of other stuff I can't remember
 
Can I help?
-----------
I will not be accepting any help such as pull requests until I get much further into development. However, that may change soon and I may put the project under the MIT license. As of now, I will be accepting issues but there isn't much to use at the moment.

How do I build this?
--------------------
Why would you it barely works...
