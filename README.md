PingyPGM
========
Just one more clone

What even is this
-----------------

A badly made clone of PGM from the mind of p i n g y 

Why is it so badly coded
------------------------
because I don't know java

What *has* been done?
---------------------
 - Some parts of /map
 - Knowledge of JDOM
 - Check if the maps directory has been already made and generate one if not

What *hasn't* been done?
------------------------
 - Support for maps other than bananaCTF
   - Ability to read the maps directory and fetching maps
 - Support for ANY game modes at all
 - Useless raindrops
 - All the other commands
 - Teams
   - Team chats
 - XML parsing
 - Probably a lot of other stuff I can't remember

Can I help?
-----------
Not yet

How do I build this?
--------------------
Why would you it barely works...
